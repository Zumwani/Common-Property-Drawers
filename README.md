# Common-Property-Drawers

This package provides a few commonly useful property drawers:
* Auto - Automatically gets a component on the game object, parent or children.
* Required - Same as Auto but displays a warning when component could not be found.
* Button - Displays a button instead of a toggle for a bool, which could either be checked in OnValidate or be bound to a method.
* Label - Displays the content of the variable in text.
* ShowIf - Only shows variable if condition is met.
